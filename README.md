# Chessboard

This is an iOS App writen in Swift, where the user can see all the paths that a knight can take on a chessboard from a starting position to an ending position in exactly 3 moves.

The app shows an empty chessboard created with UICollectionView, and prompts the user to choose a starting position and an ending position.
Then, if there are paths that the knight can take, they appear as a list in a UITableView, or if there are no paths, the app shows an appopriate message and the user can try again.

The user can also reset the board to choose other positions.
